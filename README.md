#Reservester App (similar to Open Table) using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL

##Synopsis
The intention of this project was to learn Ruby on Rails MVC architecture patterns by creating an app similar to Open Table. This application (still in progress) allows both users and owners to log in (using the Devise authentication solution) and then see/make reservations at different restaurants.
This application is unstyled, and in test. More detail on continuing work can be found in the **Next Steps** portion of this README.

##Motivation
This project originally constituted the technical course work for Startup Institute's Web Development course. The motivation behind this work was to get a better understanding of Ruby on Rails architecture, authentication and authorization and AJAX requests.

##Next Steps
This application is still very much a work in progress, and was put on hold for another project. 

Next steps will include:
* Adding AJAX requests for 'favoriting' feature
* Adding email functionality such that a restaurant Owner is emailed when a reservation is made
* Adding additional authorization logic around the views
* Writing unit tests
* Styling the application and improving the UX
* Hosting the application on Heroku
